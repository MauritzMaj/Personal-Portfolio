# Personal-Portfolio

For this challenge, I created a personal portfolio page with some samples of my work. 

The page includes my profile-pic, a short about me section, projects I've done, and contact info.

Since I don't have a ton of work yet, some links take you to a "coming soon" page.

The links in the navbar take you to the appropriate section of the page.

I made the page responsive so it adapts to mobile devices.

Here is a link to my page:
